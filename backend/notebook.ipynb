The example program evaluates the expression 5-3 in assembly language, using various instructions such as XOR, ADD, AND, OR, and NOP to perform arithmetic operations, demonstrating how data is processed and controlled within the ALU.\n",
    "A lecture on computer architecture focusing on the assembly language, instruction set, and basic components of a simple microprocessor. Key points include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instruction set: basic operations such as MOV, AND, OR, XOR, ADD, and SHIFTS\n",
    "* ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) operation in evaluating expressions like 5-3\n",
    "* Addition of memory to store program data and an instruction pointer\n",
    "* Creation of a simple microprocessor with registers A, B, and IP.\n",
    "The text describes a binary counter and a simple computer system, specifically the ZX81 Based Microcomputer. It explains how the accumulator (A) and instruction pointer (IP) work together to execute instructions, including fetching and decoding opcodes. The Z80 microprocessor is also discussed, including its architecture, register bank, ALU, and instruction cycle.\n",
